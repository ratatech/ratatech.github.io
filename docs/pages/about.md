As a Telecom Engineer I’m familiar with Information and Communication Technologies like Computer Networks, Analog and Digital Electronics, Multimedia Communications, Cloud Computing, web-based services and applications… But since long time ago I’ve become more interested in Audio and Music Technologies. Specially I like to work with Audio and Digital Signal Processing, Music and Sound Perception and Cognition, Auditory modeling, Cochlear Implants (Part of my Master Thesis research) , development of new interfaces for music interaction, Music Information Retrieval, Internet Music Services, Embedded Audio …

In my free time I like to play with all kind of music related technologies such as Arduino, Pure Data, Processing… As well as I love electronics and DIY projects such as home-made synthesizers or any kind of noisy device
