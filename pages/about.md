# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:. I'm a Telecom Engineer from [La Bisbal d'Empord√†](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Bisbal_d%27Empord%C3%A0), Catalonia, Spain. I studied in Barcelona, where I coursed the MSc in Sound and Music Computing at the [MTG](https://www.upf.edu/web/mtg). Also in close collaboration with the MTG, I did an Internship at the [Yamaha Research Center](https://www.yamaha.com/en/about/research/) in Hamamatsu, Japan. A while after that I moved to Switzerland where I still live and work as Audio DSP Engineer for [Phonak](https://www.phonak.com).

When I'm not working on my paid job, I love to work on DIY electronics projects, specially music/noisy devices. You can check a selection of the projects I've worked over the years on the [Projects]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/projects.html %}) page. Other than that, I also spend considerable amounts of time walking my dogs in the forest or digging in record shops and listening to my humble record [collection](https://www.discogs.com/es/user/ratatech/collection).
