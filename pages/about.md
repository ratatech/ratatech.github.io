# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:. I'm a Telecom Engineer from [La Bisbal d'Empord√†](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Bisbal_d%27Empord%C3%A0), Catalonia, Spain. I studied in Barcelona, where I coursed the MSc in Sound and Music Computing at the [MTG](https://www.upf.edu/web/mtg). Following that, I did an Internship at the Yamaha Research Center in Hamamatsu, Japan. Over the last years I've been living in Switzerland where I work as Audio DSP Engineer for [Phonak](https://www.phonak.com). See my [CV]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link /assets/docs/CV_Jordi_Hidalgo.pdf %}) for more details.

When I'm not working on my paid job, I love to work on DIY electronic projects, specially for music/noisy devices. You can check a selection of the projects I've worked over the years on the [Projects]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/projects.html %}) page. Other than that, I also spend considerable amounts of time walking my dogs in the forest or digging in record shops and listening to my humble record [collection](https://www.discogs.com/es/user/ratatech/collection).
