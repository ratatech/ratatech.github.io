# Sound Lab Mini-Synth

This was my attempt to build one of most popular Ray Wilsonâ€™s DIY projects, the [Sound-Lab Mini-Synth](http://musicfromouterspace.com/index.php?CATPARTNO=NONE&PROJARG=SOUNDLABMINISYNTH%2Fpage1.html&MAINTAB=SYNTHDIY&SONGID=NONE&VPW=1590&VPH=600). This was one of the first synths I build. It came out working nicely as expected, mostly thanks to the detailed explanations and recommendations on the [MFOS](http://musicfromouterspace.com) website. Great website for DIY electronic music fans, thanks Ray!
