# Handy Liebe

Handy Liebe was a project developed for the Indivendres Mil Folls interdisciplinary arts festival in La Bisbal d’Empordà (17/08/2014). During the show, several participants were called from the audience to be members of the “band” and interact with the real musicians. The only requirement was to have a smartphone which was used to connect to a remote system which was collecting data from the mobile sensors and later transformed into beats and instrument melodies.
