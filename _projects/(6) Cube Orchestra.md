description: Cube Orchestra is a live interactive system for electronic music performance where users can create and play virtual instruments with their smartphones and interact with the virtual objects in the screen. Each cube represents a synth, a sampler or a drum machine and all the melodies and patterns are created on the fly. This way, the audience gets feedback in real time from what the artists are doing. Using a homemade wood structure attached to a bed sheet to project the image, infrared sensors are used to turn it into a multitouch tactile screen.

# The Movies Project

The Movies Project is something like **Netflix**, the only difference is that **it's not real**! It doesn't exist! I just created it to demonstrate how the **showcase** page looks like and how you can write whatever you want with full markdown support.
