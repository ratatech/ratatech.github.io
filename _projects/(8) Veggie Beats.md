# Veggie Beats

Veggie Beats was a project developed for the Indivendres Mil Folls interdisciplinary arts festival in La Bisbal d’Empordà (17/08/2013). It basically consists in two sequencers, one for rhythms and another for melodies. Those are built on a wood structure with holes as a matrix, where each column represents the step of the sequencer and the rows the notes or the drums.

Each hole has placed a button which gets activated when the oranges are placed in. Additionally, some effects and control parameters can be manipulated. Just a funny way of using vegetables and play music.
