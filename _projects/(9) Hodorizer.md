# Hodorizer

Hodorizer was a Hack presented on the Music Hackday held in Barcelona within the Sonar Festival 2014 edition. The idea was to develop a tool which analyzes the content of the song and replaces the main lyrics by Hodor vocalizations. The site storing the library can still be visited on Hector Parra's (co-author) [githup page](http://hector.github.io/hodorizer/).

Technically was achieved somehow by "removing" the vocals on the center channel and filling the gap with different time-stretched vocalizations. The result is a small library of popular songs processed by the tool. Here an example:

{% include elements/video.html id="cUrQgAEH02U" caption="Hodor's Wonderwall"%}
